What's left? Most of it.

Basic requirements:
- coverage of all units of mass, length, area, volume
- conversion between all related units
- metric and imperial support, possibly with rational number support for imperial
- a clean way of distinguishing between US and UK units of the same name

After that, I suppose there's all sorts of further units to cover.
